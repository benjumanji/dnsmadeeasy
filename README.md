dnsmadeeasy
===========

Testing here?

Dynamic DNS for dnsmadeeasy. This is a simple util that takes a record id and an ip address along with dnsmadeeasy credentials and updates the DNS record appropriately. Has rudimentary checking for problems. 

TODO: better logging.

This now says something different. What will happen?
